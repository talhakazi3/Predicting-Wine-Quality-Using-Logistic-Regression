# Predicting-Wine-Quality-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project applies Logistic Regression to predict wine quality based on various physicochemical features such as acidity, alcohol content, and sulphates. The goal is to build a robust machine learning model that classifies wines as good or bad based on measurable chemical properties.
